# Tutorial - Tonn API: Automating Audio Mixing

## Introduction
Imagine you have multiple audio tracks recorded separately‚Äîinstruments like drums, bass, guitar, plus vocals‚Äîand you need a professional mix that balances them seamlessly.  The **Tonn API** allows you to automate this process, ensuring clarity, depth, and consistency in your audio mix. This guide will walk you through:
- Creating a **preview mix** to test your setup
- Polling for **mix status updates** so you know when it's ready
- Using **webhooks** instead of polling for real-time updates
- Retrieving the **final mix** for your production
- Extracting **audio effect settings** for fine-tuning
- Adjusting **track levels** in decibels before finalizing the mix

## Why Use the Tonn API?
Mixing music manually can be time-consuming and technically challenging. Whether you're an independent musician, producer, or developer integrating audio features into an application, the Tonn API provides an easy way to get professional-quality mixes in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Python installed on your system
- The `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- A valid API key for authentication

## Base API URL
All API requests should be made to:

```
https://tonn.roexaudio.com
```

## Step 1: Creating a Preview Mix
The first step is to send your tracks to the API and create a preview mix. This mix lets you hear how your tracks sound together before committing to a final mix.

### How It Works
When you send a `POST` request to `/mixpreview`, the API takes your tracks, applies professional mixing techniques, and generates a preview mix. This step doesn‚Äôt consume any credits, allowing you to tweak and experiment freely.

Including a `webhookURL` in your request payload is **mandatory**. This ensures you receive a notification when the preview mix is ready, eliminating the need for polling.

### Endpoint Details
- **Endpoint**: `POST /mixpreview`
- **Consumes**: `application/json`
- **Response Codes**:
  - `200`: Success, returns `multitrack_task_id`
  - `400`: Bad Request (Invalid input)
  - `401`: Unauthorized (API key missing/invalid)
  - `500`: Internal Server Error

### Example JSON Payload with Webhook
Save this as `preview_payload.json`:

```json
{
  "multitrackData": {
    "trackData": [
      {
        "trackURL": "https://example.com/vocals.wav",
        "instrumentGroup": "VOCAL_GROUP",
        "presenceSetting": "LEAD",
        "panPreference": "CENTRE",
        "reverbPreference": "LOW"
      },
      {
        "trackURL": "https://example.com/drums.wav",
        "instrumentGroup": "DRUMS_GROUP",
        "presenceSetting": "NORMAL",
        "panPreference": "CENTRE",
        "reverbPreference": "NONE"
      }
    ],
    "musicalStyle": "POP",
    "returnStems": false,
    "sampleRate": 44100,
    "webhookURL": "https://example.com/webhook"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Polling for Preview Mix Completion (For Debugging)
Polling is generally not required since webhooks provide real-time updates. However, you can use polling as a backup method for debugging or verifying status manually.

### Retrieving Mix Output Settings
Once the preview mix is complete, the API returns **mix output settings** for each track, including:
- **Dynamic range compression (DRC) settings**
- **Equalization (EQ) settings**
- **Gain adjustments**
- **Panning preferences**

#### Example of Mix Output Settings
```plaintext
Track: masks-bass.wav
  drc_settings:
    attack_ms: 0.074
    ratio: 1.8
    release_ms: 0.022
    threshold: -3.89
  eq_settings:
    band_1: {"centre_freq": 46.5, "gain": -1.69, "q": 2.66}
    band_2: {"centre_freq": 96.69, "gain": -2.73, "q": 2.42}
  gain_settings:
    gain_db: -11.8
```
These settings allow you to fine-tune the mix before finalizing it.

### Step 3: Adjusting Track Levels & Retrieving the Final Mix
Once you‚Äôre happy with the preview mix, you can send adjustments for individual track levels before retrieving the final mix.

### Example JSON Payload
Save this as `final_payload.json`:

```json
{
  "applyAudioEffectsData": {
    "multitrackTaskId": "TASK_ID_HERE",
    "trackData": [
      {
        "trackURL": "https://example.com/vocals.wav",
        "gainDb": 0.0
      },
      {
        "trackURL": "https://example.com/drums.wav",
        "gainDb": -2.0
      }
    ],
    "returnStems": false,
    "sampleRate": 44100
  }
}
```
